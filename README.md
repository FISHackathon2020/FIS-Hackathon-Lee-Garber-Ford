This is my Resume Scanner project! It's a website that looks at people's resumes for key words in a variety of categories. Then, it uses these results to help show people's proficency in 12 different skills - helping save tons of time for employers and allowing students to check their own resumes!

A live demo can be found at https://14ms0.csb.app/.
